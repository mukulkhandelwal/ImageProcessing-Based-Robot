## ImageProcessing-Based-Robot

It is an project developed for the competition in IIT Bombay Pixelate.<br>

In this project A-Star Algorithm is used for finding shortest path.<br>
In this project one overhead camera captures the images one frame per sec and that image will be processed my our algorithm and control our robot where to go and where not. <br>
This project based on the PID algorithm in which robot detects to go on a right  path.<br> 

In this project we also shows how to implement Twiddle algorithm.
<br>
You can find the problem statement in Pixelate document which is present in this repository as name pixelate.
For any queries regarding code you can ask me any question .
You can comment or You can mail me on -mukulsuperstarrock@gmail.com
