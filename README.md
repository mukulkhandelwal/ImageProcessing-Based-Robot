# ImageProcessing-Based-Robot

It is an project developed for the competition in IIT Bombay Pixelate.

In this project A-Star Algorithm is used for finding shortest path.
In this project one overhead camera captures the images one frame per sec and that image will be processed my our algorithm and control our robot 
where to go and where not. 
This project based on the PID algorithm in which robot detects to go on a right  path. 

In this project we also shows how to implement Twiddle algorithm.
